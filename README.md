CSS Flexbox offers a powerful set of properties that provide precise control over element layout within a flexible container. By using these properties, developers can arrange, align, and adjust items in a way that is responsive to the available space, allowing for a more adaptable and intuitive user interface.

Primary flex container properties:

- **flex-direction**: Determines the main axis of the flex container, setting the direction in which items are arranged, either horizontally or vertically.
  
- **flex-wrap**: Specifies if flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or remain on a single line. This is especially useful for responsive design, as it controls whether items should adjust to fit within the container's width or height.

- **flex-flow**: A shorthand property that combines `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`. This is helpful for setting both properties in one line for simplicity.

- **justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis, distributing any remaining space between them. It allows for alignment such as centering, spacing around, or evenly spacing items.

- **align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis (the axis perpendicular to the main axis). This property affects each item’s alignment when there is extra space in the container’s height or width.

- **align-content**: Used when items wrap onto multiple lines; it aligns these lines along the cross axis, distributing extra space between them.

- **order**: Specifies the position of each item within the container, allowing individual items to be reordered independently of their original position in the HTML code.

- **flex-grow**: Dictates how much an item will expand relative to other items if there is extra space available. A higher `flex-grow` value makes an item grow proportionally larger compared to others.

- **flex-shrink**: Controls how much an item will shrink relative to the other items if there is not enough space in the container.

- **flex-basis**: Defines the initial size of a flex item before the remaining space is distributed. It can be set in units such as pixels, percentages, or auto.

- **flex**: A shorthand property that combines `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` into a single, more compact definition.
